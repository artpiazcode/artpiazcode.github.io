### Abuse Protection

In Ads Abuse and Core Counter Abuse, I led teams of software engineers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists to use AI to understand and mitigate abuse. 

My teams built models for enforcing Ads policies and abuse protection solutions for YouTube, Android messaging, Google Workspace, etc. to protect users from abuses such as phishing, counterfeit and confusing/clickbait ads.

My team's contributions for Google Ads Safety featured in <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/google-ads-safety-report-2023/#enforcement">2023 Google Ads Safety Report</a>.
