I am interested in Applied AI/ML, particularly in NLP/NLU, LLMs and Generative AI.

I currently work at <a href='https://www.tempus.com'>Tempus AI</a> with an amazing team of ML Scientists, Engineers and Product delivering AI powered products for advancing precision medicine.

Before that, I worked at <a href='https://www.google.com'>Google Inc.</a> as an engineering leader in several PAs in abuse protection and conversational AI domains.
