Greetings!

I am interested in Applied AI/ML, with a particularl focus in NLP/NLU, LLMs and Generative AI.

Currently, I work at <a href='https://www.tempus.com'>Tempus AI</a> with an amazing team of ML Scientists, Engineers and Product delivering AI powered products for advancing precision medicine.

Before that, I worked at <a href='https://www.google.com'>Google Inc.</a> contributing to multiple teams within the domains of abuse protection and conversational AI.

For additional details about my past work, visit my <a href="projects.md">Past Projects</a> page.
