### Abuse Protection

At Google, in Ads Abuse and Core Counter Abuse, I led teams of software engineers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists to use AI to understand and mitigate abuse. 

These teams are focussed on increasing the digital safety of Googleâ€™s products (Ads, Gmail, Android, Apps, YouTube) against malicious interactions. As part of this, we built several models for enforcing Ads policies and abuse protection solutions to protect users from abuses such as phishing, counterfeit and confusing/clickbait ads.

My team's contributions for Google Ads Safety was featured in <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/google-ads-safety-report-2023/">2023 Google Ads Safety Report</a>.
