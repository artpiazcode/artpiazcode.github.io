### Abuse Protection

At Google, I led cross-functional teams of software engineers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists within the Ads Abuse and Core Counter Abuse divisions. Together, we leveraged AI to detect and mitigate abuse across Google’s products.

Our focus was on enhancing the digital safety of platforms such as Ads, Gmail, Android, Apps, and YouTube, protecting them from malicious interactions. We developed and deployed a range of models aimed at enforcing advertising policies and safeguarding users from abuses such as phishing, counterfeit content and clickbait ads.

Notably, our team’s contributions to Google Ads Safety were highlighted in the <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/google-ads-safety-report-2023/">2023 Google Ads Safety Report</a>.
